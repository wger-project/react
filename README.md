# react components for wger

This repository contains the React components for the wger app. Note that this React app is not supposed to be used by
itself, but rather as a library that is used in wger.

# Getting Started

Copy `.env.TEMPLATE` to `.env.development` and edit it to your needs.

You can use your own instance, but feel free to use the test server (the db
is reset every day):

* URL: `https://wger-master.rge.uber.space`
* username: `user`
* password: `flutteruser`
* API key: `31e2ea0322c07b9df583a9b6d1e794f7139e78d4`

Then, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
