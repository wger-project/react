# react components for wger

This repository contains the React components for the wger app. Note that this
React app is not supposed to be used by itself, but rather as a library of
components that are then used in wger.

# Getting Started

Our goal is to build an awesome and flexible fitness and nutrition manager,
along with a comprehensive list of exercises and ingredients, all released
under a free license.

For this, we’d love your help! Whether it’s code, translations, exercises or
reporting issues and ideas, check out our
[contribution guide](https://wger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
to get started.

A huge thank you to everyone who has contributed so far! ❤️ See the full list
in [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).

**TLDR**

```bash
# with node > 22

cp .env.TEMPLATE .env.development
vim .env.development
npm install
npm start 
```

This is a regular react application, so there's no magic. You will need a backend
for this, so feel free to use the test server for this (the db is reset daily):
